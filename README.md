OS labs in BNU

> I'm sorry that all the labs are done by online reference, hoping you can realise the knowledge by yourself;

**In case of infringement, please contact to delete;**

## labs1 & labs2

Reference: 

CSDN from [zheliku](https://blog.csdn.net/zheliku);

## labs3

I have passed the teacher check, but my one classmate told me that there were some problems in the code;

So what the teacher will ask you?

* What is the definition of your buffer?
* What is the parameter in the function?
* Why can't exchange the operation of P?
* Run your code, remember print the products that your produce or consume;


## labs4

②[Reference2](https://blog.csdn.net/Growing2020/article/details/121697973) `(showinfo(),code structure)`

## labs5 

If you want to do this lab, please learn the knowledge about it or you will feel so painful;

It seems that it's hard to find the same or similar code if you just search for the content of lab document.But my one classmate gets the original code by searching for "pageFIFO.exe".The code is also put into the file named "page(1).c";

## labs6

Thanks to my one classmate, who gave me the labs about OS from other seniors and Mr.C, I could finish the considerable work in just 2 days. What I did in this lab was to correct bugs the teacher had told us. And there must be other errors in the code, but I think I couldn't find them.

The functions I added were also normal, just for reference. I think you could do better!
