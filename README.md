I have passed the teacher check, but my one classmate told me that there were some problems in the code;

So what the teacher will ask you?

* What is the definition of your buffer?
* What is the parameter in the function?
* Why can't exchange the operation of P?
* Run your code, remember print the products that your produce or consume;
